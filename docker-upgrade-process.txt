# Setting up cloud machine

1. Start with fresh NubesVMS cloud machine
2. Clone and `cd` into infraportal_setup
3. Copy over database dump
4. Unzip database file and rename as infraportal.sql - place in infraportal_setup dir
5. Run infra_setup.sh (requires elevated privilege)
  a. Use the `-u` flag to have the current user set as owner of the infraportal files
6. run `drush cr` from the infraportal folder after waiting a few mins for the db to import

N.B on the prod branch, the .htaccess folder needs to be edited to stop redirecting to infraportal.org
    Copy over .htaccess from existing prod/beta servers?
